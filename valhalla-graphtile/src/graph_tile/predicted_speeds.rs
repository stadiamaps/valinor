//! # Predicted (Historical) Traffic
//!
//! Helpers for working with predicted speeds.
//! These speeds can optionally be encoded in the edge info for each graph tile.
//! The average speeds are broken up into equal-sized windows (hardcoded at 5 minutes in Valhalla)
//! That's a lot of data, so it's stored in a compressed form by applying a DCT-II transformation.
//! When routing, it's decompressed using the inverse operation (DTC-III).
//!
//! NOTE: The term "predicted speed" is preserved from Valhalla.
//! However, it's perhaps more accurate to understand it as historical average speeds,
//! which are useful for prediction as long as there isn't a special event,
//! temporary lane closure, etc.
//!
//! This code is ported from [Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla)'s baldr module
//! (predictedspeeds.cc and predictedspeeds.h).
//! The original code is available under the MIT license.
